# Music Service Web Project

The original purpose of this project is to complete the assignment (KMUTT, CSS227), which had minimum functionality requirement as follow:

-   [USER] Sign up, Sign in, Sign out (User / Manager)
-   [USER] My Page
    -   Show personal information
    -   List of favorite songs
-   [USER] Search songs by title & artist
    -   Show title, artist, genre, etc.
-   [BONUS] [USER] Sort search results by title & artist
    -   Sort results by clicking the sort button
-   [USER] Song description page
    -   Title, Cover image, lyrics, etc.
    -   User access to this page by clicking the song on the search results.
-   [USER] Add songs from search results to the favorite or download list
-   [USER] Show most favorite songs
-   [BONUS] [USER] Buy memberships to use additional services
-   [ADMIN] Add new songs or artists to DB
-   [ADMIN] Delete a user from the service

## Admin Side Branch

This repository is created for practice & study. A music service web made with MERN stack, this branch is for admin access only site, which admin can do every CRUD operation with the collections. I did not use 'redux-persist' in this project due to a lack of understanding and not enough time left before the assignment's deadline. As a result, many of the redux states in my project did not meet their full potential.

I'm still at the beginners level and only studied MERN stack for one month (while making this project), I understand and apologized in case my code seems weird or bad from a senior/professional perspective, if you have any advice I'm willing to expand my knowledge.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
