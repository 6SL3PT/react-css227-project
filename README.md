# Music Service Web Project

This repository is created for practice & study. A music service web made with MERN stack, this branch is for server back-end of both sites (client & admin).

The original purpose of this project is to complete the assignment (KMUTT, CSS227), which had minimum functionality requirement as follow:

-   [USER] Sign up, Sign in, Sign out (User / Manager)
-   [USER] My Page
    -   Show personal information
    -   List of favorite songs
-   [USER] Search songs by title & artist
    -   Show title, artist, genre, etc.
-   [BONUS] [USER] Sort search results by title & artist
    -   Sort results by clicking the sort button
-   [USER] Song description page
    -   Title, Cover image, lyrics, etc.
    -   User access to this page by clicking the song on the search results.
-   [USER] Add songs from search results to the favorite or download list
-   [USER] Show most favorite songs
-   [BONUS] [USER] Buy memberships to use additional services
-   [ADMIN] Add new songs or artists to DB
-   [ADMIN] Delete a user from the service

I'm still at the beginners level and only studied MERN stack for one month (while making this project), I understand and apologized in case my code seems weird or bad from a senior/professional perspective, if you have any advice I'm willing to expand my knowledge.
